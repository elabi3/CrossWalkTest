# CrossWalkTest

Goals:

  - Learn how to use an Android system webview
  - Learn how to use a third party webview (Crosswalk)
  - Performance test with both webviews

# Test

  - https://chromium.github.io/octane/
  - http://www.wirple.com/bmark/

Device: Nexus 4 (mako) - Android 5.1.1 (api 22)

| WebView | Crosswalk |
| ------ | ------ |
| Octane:  | Octane:  |
| wirple:   | wirple: 96 |
